**Dementia**

What is common between Hollywood superstar Bruce Willis, former British
prime minister Margaret Thatcher and former US president Ronald Reagan?
They all had dementia.

Dementia is a group of conditions that affect thinking, memory, and
behaviour. There is a decline in cognitive function that interferes with
daily life. Cognitive function means understanding what is going on
around you and responding appropriately. For example, if you are hungry, you may ask for food. Or if somebody asks you the time of the day, you will look at the watch and give the
time. These kind of thinking goes down. Eventually the person loses complete
brain function and almost becomes vegetative. 

As the life spans of people are increasing, we are seeing more cases of
dementia. In 1907, Bavarian psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer was the first to identify
progressive dementia in the brain of 51-year-old Auguste Deter. Since
then, the science has made a huge progress in characterising and
managing the disease.

Dementia is a major global problem now.

1.  There are over **57 million people** living with the condition
    worldwide

2.  Every year an estimated **10 million new cases** get added.

3.  In 2021, it was ranked as the **seventh leading cause of death,
    killing 1.8 million lives**.

4.  By 2050, there may be over **150 million** dementia patients
    globally.

5.  The global costs of dementia care were around **US\$818 billion** in
    2015. 

6.  By 2050 the estimated global cost will be **\$9.12 trillion**.

It is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the progressive loss of
neurons. The brain keeps shrinking.

If you have seen the movie "The father" where the character of Anthony
Hopkins is a dementia patient, you will understand the enormity of this
condition and how it affects the entire family.

There are different types of dementia: for example, Alzheimer\'s
Disease, Vascular Dementia, Lewy Body Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia. The way these dementias develop are different for each type but the basic problem is generally the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain and/or cerebrovascular disease, leading to damage to neurons and
slow decline in the brain activities. 

Nobody knows exactly what causes dementia. But generally, the risk
factors can be

- obesity,

- alcohol consumption,

- smoking,

- chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol etc.

- deafness

- social isolation

- traumatic brain injury

Therefore, though there is no preventive strategy that can guarantee
freedom from dementia, following general steps can definitely reduce the
risk of dementias.

This can involve adopting a healthy lifestyle, staying mentally and
physically active, and addressing underlying health conditions.

Basically, whatever precautions you take to prevent heart attacks, are
also applicable to dementia. And then there are some more.

**Physical Activity**

Engaging in regular physical activity, such as 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity per week, can improve cardiovascular health
and potentially reduce dementia risk.

**Healthy Diet**

A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can
support overall health and potentially reduce the risk of dementia.

**Smoking Cessation**

Quitting smoking is crucial.

**Alcohol Consumption**:

Limiting alcohol intake to recommended levels can help reduce the risk
of dementia.

**Healthy Weight**:

Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of conditions like
diabetes and high blood pressure, which are linked to dementia.

**Managing High Blood Pressure**:

If you have hypertension, it should be controlled with medicines and
other lifestyle changes.

**Diabetes Management**:

Controlling blood sugar levels through diet, exercise, and medication
can help prevent or delay the onset of dementia.

**High Cholesterol**:

Managing high cholesterol levels through diet and medication can reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease and potentially dementia.

**Keep Learning**:

Keep your brain engaged in mentally stimulating activities, such as
learning new skills or hobbies or solving puzzles. This can help
maintain cognitive function.

**Social Connection**:

Maintain your social connections. Keep meeting friends and relatives and
have meaningful relations with them. Social isolation is not good for
brain function.

**Hearing Loss**:

Deafness has been found to increase risk of dementia. Using hearing aids
or other interventions can help reduce the risk of dementia.

**Vision Loss:**

If there are any vision problems, please solve them through medical
intervention, such as cataract removal surgery. Vision loss can lead to
social isolation as well low stimulation to brain.

**Air Pollution:**

Reducing exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to
cognitive decline.

**Brain trauma**

Avoid brain trauma by appropriate headgears.  For example, boxers are at
a higher risk of developing dementia, because of repeated head trauma.

**Shingles vaccine**

A vaccination program in Wales found that the shingles vaccine appeared
to lower risk of dementia by 20%.
