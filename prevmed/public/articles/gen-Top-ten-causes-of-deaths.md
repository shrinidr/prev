**Top 10 causes of deaths worldwide**

Whenever we talk about health, we are most worried about deaths.
Therefore, it will be good to know the most common reasons of deaths in
the world. If we can prevent them, we decrease the risks of early deaths
substantially.

Let's look at the top 10 Causes of Death given by the World Health
Organization for 2019 that happened worldwide.


| **Rank** | **Cause of Death**                  | **Deaths (Millions)** | **% of Global Deaths** |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| 1        | Heart attacks                        | 8.9                   | 16%                     |
| 2        | Stroke                               | 6.0                   | 11%                     |

### If we look at the breakdown by Communicable vs Non-communicable vs Injury:


| **Category**                                | **Examples in Top 10**                                   | **Notes**                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-communicable diseases**               | Heart disease, Stroke, COPD, Cancers, Dementia, Diabetes, Kidney disease | Account for **7 of top 10 causes**, ~74% of global deaths |
| **Communicable, maternal, newborn, nutritional conditions** | Lower respiratory infections, Neonatal conditions, Diarrhoeal diseases | Still major killers, especially in low-income countries |
| **Injuries**                                | Not in top 10 globally (but road injuries rank high ages 5–29) | Important in younger groups |


There are differences in the causes in the rich countries and poor
countries. Let's look at the ranking based on where they occur.

These tables show a clear picture:

- **Low-income countries** → Still dominated by **communicable,
  maternal, newborn, nutritional causes** like infections, malaria, TB,
  diarrhoea.

- **Middle-income countries** → Transition phase: Non-communicable
  diseases like heart disease, stroke, diabetes + still significant
  infectious diseases and road injuries.

- **High-income countries** → Almost entirely **non-communicable
  diseases** like dementia, cancers, heart disease, kidney disease.
