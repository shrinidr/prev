the global burden of depression is increasing. 

Depression is diagnosed when someone has persistent sadness and loss of
interest in activities. People with depression are at increased risk of
suicide.

Women are more likely to experience depression than men, possibly due to
hormonal fluctuations, childbirth, and societal stress factors.

The mean age of onset is around 40, but there\'s an increasing trend of
depression in younger populations due to factors like substance abuse.

Depression is more common in individuals without close interpersonal
relationships, those who are divorced or separated, or widowed.
