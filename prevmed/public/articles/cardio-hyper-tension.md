**High blood pressure**

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects a significant portion of
the adult population globally.

- **Global Prevalence:**

> The World Health Organization estimates that **1.28 billion adults**
> aged 30-79 years have hypertension, according to a recent report from
> WHO, with most living in low- and middle-income countries. 

- **Awareness:**

> A significant number of people with hypertension are unaware of their
> condition. Around **46% of adults** with hypertension are unaware they
> have it. 

- **Control Rates:**

> Only approximately **21% of adults** with hypertension have it under
> control. Rest have it beyond control.

- **Age and Hypertension:**

> The prevalence of hypertension increases with age. In many countries,
> 50% of individuals **over 60 years of age** have hypertension. 

Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, and
contributes to a significant number of deaths worldwide. 

**Risk Factors for High Blood Pressure:**

- **Unhealthy Diet:** Diets high in sodium (salt) and low in potassium
  can contribute to high blood pressure.

- **Lack of Physical Activity:** Being physically inactive increases the
  risk of developing hypertension.

- **Obesity:** Excess weight puts extra strain on the heart and blood
  vessels, increasing blood pressure.

- **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:** Heavy drinking can raise blood
  pressure.

- **Smoking:** Nicotine in tobacco damages blood vessels and raises
  blood pressure.

- **Stress:** Chronic stress can elevate blood pressure. 

- **Age:** The risk of high blood pressure increases with age.

- **Family History:** A family history of high blood pressure increases
  your risk.

- **Chronic Kidney Disease:** Kidney problems can affect blood pressure
  regulation.

- **Race/Ethnicity:** Certain racial and ethnic groups have a higher
  risk.

- **Urban vs. Rural:** Studies have shown a higher prevalence of
  hypertension in urban areas compared to rural areas.

- **Gender Differences:** Some studies indicate a slightly higher
  prevalence of hypertension among men than women. 

**Prevention:**

- **Healthy Diet:** Follow a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole
  grains, and low in sodium, saturated and trans fats, and cholesterol.

- **Regular Physical Activity:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of
  moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic
  activity per week, along with strength training exercises

- **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Losing even a small amount of weight
  can help lower blood pressure.

- **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** If you drink, do so in moderation (up
  to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men).

- **Quit Smoking:** Smoking damages blood vessels and significantly
  increases the risk of high blood pressure.

- **Manage Stress:** Find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as
  exercise, relaxation techniques, or spending time on hobbies.

- **Monitor Blood Pressure:** Regularly check your blood pressure at
  home or at a clinic, especially if you have risk factors.

- **Medication:** If lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may
  prescribe medication to lower your blood pressure.
