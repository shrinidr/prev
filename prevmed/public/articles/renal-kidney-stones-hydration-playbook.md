**Kidney stones**

We all have **two kidneys** which are bean-shaped organs in our abdomen.
They are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluid from the
blood.

This waste gets carried from kidney to the urinary bladder via ureters
and ultimately is thrown out through urethra. This is what happens when
we urinate.


By doing this act of excretion, the kidneys also maintain **fluid and
electrolyte balance, and regulate blood pressure**. 

They also **produce hormones** that play a crucial role in red blood
cell production, calcium uptake, and bone health. 

In some people **urine becomes supersaturated with certain minerals**.
This high concentration can cause these minerals to **precipitate out of
solution and form crystals.** They turn into hard masses that are called
kidney stones.

By the way, which are these minerals that make stones? **Calcium,
oxalate, or uric acid.** This means diet rich in these minerals can
increase the risk of kidney stones.

They are a common urological problem.

**Epidemiology**

- Kidney stones are a common condition, affecting an estimated around
  **10-12% of** global population**.**

- They have a higher prevalence in **men** compared to women.

- The risk of developing kidney stones increases with age, particularly
  **after 40 in men and in the 50s for women.**

- Certain geographic regions, particularly **hotter, drier climates,**
  are known to have higher rates of kidney stones.

- Certain ethnic groups, like **Caucasians**, have a higher reported
  prevalence of calcium stones. 

**Risk Factors:**

- **Fluid intake**: **Inadequate fluid intake and dehydration** are
  major risk factors. If you drink enough water, the minerals get thrown
  out with urine and deposit and make crystals.

- **High sodium intake**: Increased sodium can raise the amount of
  calcium the kidneys must filter.

- **High animal protein intake**: This can lead to increased uric acid
  production and making the urine acidic, promoting stone formation.

- **High oxalate foods**: Certain foods are high in oxalate; **Spinach,
  rhubarb, beets, Swiss chard, chocolate, nuts, seeds, and some
  legumes**. They can contribute to calcium oxalate stone formation.

- **High sugar intake**: Excessive sugar consumption, particularly
  fructose, has been linked to increased stone risk.

- **Obesity**: Individuals with obesity have a higher risk of developing
  kidney stones.

- **Medical conditions**: Conditions like **hyperparathyroidism,
  inflammatory bowel disease, and certain genetic conditions** can
  increase stone risk.

- **Family history**: A family history of kidney stones can increase an
  individual\'s risk.

- **Medications**: Certain medications, including **some diuretics and
  vitamin C supplements**, can increase the risk.

**Prevention**

- **Maintaining adequate fluid intake is the most important preventative
  measure, aiming for 2.5-3 liters of fluid daily.**

  - **Reduce salt consumption** to lower the risk of calcium oxalate
    stones.

  - **Lowering animal protein intake** can help regulate uric acid
    levels.

  - Limit foods high in oxalate.

  - While calcium is important, **excessive calcium intake may
    increase** the risk of calcium oxalate stones.

- **Maintaining a healthy weight** can reduce the risk of kidney stones.

- **Treatment of underlying medical conditions**, such as
  hyperparathyroidism, can help prevent stone formation.

- Discuss with your doctor any medications that might increase stone
  risk and consider alternative options if necessary.
