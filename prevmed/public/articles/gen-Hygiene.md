**Hygiene**

Adolf Hitler, Howard Hughes, and Saddam Hussein suffered from a
condition called mysophobia. It is a [<u>pathological
fear</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia) of contamination
and [<u>germs</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism). The term was
coined in 1879 when a case of obsessive--compulsive disorder (OCD)
exhibited repeated hands washing.

That brings us to the topic of hygiene.

Cambridge dictionary defines hygiene as
"the [<u>degree</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/degree) to
which [<u>people</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/people) [<u>keep</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/keep) themselves
or [<u>their</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/their) [<u>environment</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/environment) [<u>clean</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/clean), [<u>especially</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/especially) to [<u>prevent</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/prevent) [<u>disease</u>](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/disease)".

CDC says "Hygiene refers to behaviours that can improve cleanliness and
lead to good health."

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines hygiene as "practices that
maintain health and prevent disease spread". 

**Good hygiene practices include :**

- **Handwashing**: Wash hands frequently with soap and water,
  particularly before eating, after using the restroom, after coughing
  or sneezing, and after touching potentially contaminated surfaces.

- **Bathing/Showering**: Shower or bathe regularly, ideally daily, to
  remove dirt, sweat, and odor.

- **Oral Hygiene**: Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss
  daily to maintain oral health and prevent cavities.

- **Hair Hygiene**: Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and
  healthy.

- **Nail Hygiene**: Trim fingernails and toenails regularly to prevent
  dirt buildup and potential infections.

- **Clothing Hygiene**: Wear clean clothes daily to prevent body odor
  and the spread of germs.

- **Food Hygiene**: Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating,
  cook food to proper temperatures, and avoid cross-contamination by
  using separate cutting boards for raw and cooked foods.

- **Respiratory Hygiene**: Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or
  sneezing, preferably with a tissue or your elbow, and wash your hands
  afterward.

- **Personal Items**: Avoid sharing personal hygiene items like
  toothbrushes, razors, and towels to prevent the spread of germs.

- **Environmental Hygiene**: Keep your living spaces clean, including
  kitchen counters, sinks, and other frequently used surfaces, to
  minimize the risk of contamination.

- **Pet Hygiene**: Wash your hands after handling pets, and ensure their
  living areas are clean to prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases.
