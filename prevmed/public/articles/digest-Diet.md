**Diet**

Pizza, burger, French fries, ice cream, soft drinks -- these are some of
the most popular food items in the world. These are mouth-watering foods
but can you eat them every day?

That's why we need dietary guidelines about what and how much to eat to
promote health and prevent disease.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a diet that is rich in
fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains.

WHO also recommends to limit the intake of salt, free sugars, and fats,
particularly saturated and trans fats.

At least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables should be consumed daily.

**Key Recommendations:**

- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Consume at least 400 grams (5 portions) of
  a variety of fruits and vegetables daily, excluding potatoes and other
  starchy roots.

- **Legumes, Nuts, and Whole Grains:** Include legumes (e.g., lentils,
  beans), nuts, and whole grains (e.g., unprocessed maize, millet, oats,
  wheat, brown rice) in your daily diet.

- **Fats:** Limit total fat intake to less than 30% of your daily
  calories, and reduce saturated fat intake to less than 10%.

- **Sugars:** Reduce free sugar intake to less than 10% of total energy
  intake, with a further reduction to less than 5% for additional health
  benefits.

- **Salt:** Consume salt in moderation, keeping intake to a minimum.

- **Physical Activity:** Engage in regular physical activity and
  maintain a healthy body weight.

- **Food Safety:** Ensure that food is safe and clean, and adopt
  appropriate cooking methods.

- **Variety:** Consume a wide variety of foods from different food
  groups to ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients.

**Specific Considerations:**

- **Fruits and Vegetables:** These are excellent sources of vitamins,
  minerals, and fiber, which are important for overall health.

- **Legumes:** Legumes are a good source of protein, fiber, and other
  nutrients.

- **Nuts and Seeds:** Nuts and seeds are rich in healthy fats, protein,
  and fiber.

- **Whole Grains:** Whole grains are a good source of fiber and complex
  carbohydrates, which can help regulate blood sugar levels.

- **Fats:** Unsaturated fats, found in foods like olive oil, avocados,
  and nuts, are healthier than saturated and trans fats.

- **Sugars:** Reduce intake of sugary drinks, processed foods, and other
  foods high in added sugars.

- **Salt:** Excessive salt intake can lead to high blood pressure and
  other health problems.

- **Physical Activity:** Regular physical activity can help with weight
  management, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and improve overall
  well-being.

**Daily calorie intake**

The recommended daily calorie intake for adults varies based on several
factors, including age, sex, height, weight, and activity level.

- **Age:** Calorie needs generally decrease with age, with older adults
  requiring fewer calories.

- **Sex:** Men typically need more calories than women due to
  differences in body composition and muscle mass.

- **Activity Level:** Individuals who are more physically active will
  require more calories to fuel their activities.

- **Weight and Height:** Taller and heavier individuals generally need
  more calories than shorter and lighter individuals.

**General Recommendations:**

  
| **Sex** | **Recommended daily calories**       |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Men     | 2,000 to 3,000 calories per day       |
| Women   | 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day       |

**Important Considerations:**

- **Individual Needs:** These are general guidelines. Individual needs
  can vary significantly, so it\'s best to consult with a healthcare
  professional or registered dietitian for personalized recommendations.

- **Weight Management:** To maintain weight, consume the number of
  calories your body needs. **If you want to lose weight, you\'ll need
  to create a calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body
  burns.**

- **Balanced Diet:** Focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits,
  vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains, regardless of your calorie
  intake.

- **Empty Calories:** Be mindful of \"empty calories\" from processed
  foods and sugary drinks, which can contribute to weight gain without
  providing essential nutrients.

- **Consult a Professional:** If you have specific health concerns or
  are unsure about your calorie needs, consult with a healthcare
  professional or registered dietitian.

**Macronutrients**

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend the following proportion
of macronutrients in the diet:



| **Macronutrient** | **Recommended proportion in daily calories**|
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| Carbohydrates     | 45% to 65%      |
| Fat   | 20% to 35%       |
| Protein   | 10% to 35%       |



Please note that the specific percentages can vary based on individual
needs and activity levels. 

Please note that the daily **protein intake recommendation is 0.8 grams
per kilogram of body weight** for sedentary adults, with higher needs
for active individuals.
