**Acidity**

Acidity, or acid reflux, is a very common problem. In fact, there is
hardly anybody in the world who never faced acid reflux.

**Epidemiology:**

- Acid reflux is prevalent globally with higher rates in developed
  countries. 

- Delayed stomach emptying, where food doesn\'t leave the stomach
  quickly enough, can increase acid buildup and reflux. 

**Risk Factors:**

- **Lifestyle:** Obesity, smoking, inactivity, alcohol consumption, and
  eating before bed increase the risk. 

- **Diet:** Fatty, spicy, and acidic foods can trigger acid reflux. 

- **Medical Conditions**: Hiatal hernias, where part of the stomach
  protrudes into the chest, can worsen reflux. 

- **Medications**: Certain drugs, including painkillers and
  antidepressants, can contribute to acid reflux. 

- **Postprandial Supination**: Lying down immediately after eating can
  make acid reflux more likely.
