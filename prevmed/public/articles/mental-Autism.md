**Autism**

Autism (medical term - Autism spectrum disorder, ASD) is a neurological
and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others,
communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any
age, it is described as a "developmental disorder" because symptoms
generally appear in the first two years of life. 

Autism prevalence is increasing, with some studies reporting a threefold
increase in incidence rates over the past three decades. This is
primarily because broader criteria are applied to diagnose cases. This
has increased the numbers. Also, people are generally more aware of the
condition and seek care if they notice something off in a child.

This rise has fuelled a wrong claim that vaccines cause autism.
Unfortunately, celebrities like Robert DE Nero, Jessica Biel, Jim Carrey
etc. have supported this theory.

While precise causes are mostly unknown, multiple studies across the
world have shown that vaccines do not cause autism.

In fact, research has shown that autism is highly heritable and
polygenic. Environmental factors play a relatively small role, mainly
prenatally.

Autism cannot be definitively prevented; however, you can work on the
risk factors. Taking good care during pregnancy and minimizing exposure
to certain risk factors can help reduce the likelihood of ASD.

## Epidemiology

- WHO estimates the international prevalence of ASD at 0.76%; however,
  this only accounts for approximately 16% of the global child
  population.

- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates about
  1.68% of United States (US) children aged 8 years (or 1 in 59
  children) are diagnosed with ASD.

- The majority of increase in ASD prevalence from 1980--1991 was based
  on changes of diagnostic criteria and inclusion of outpatient data,
  rather than a true increase in ASD prevalence.

- ASD occurs in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, but
  caucasian children are consistently identified with ASD more often
  than black or Hispanic children.

- The discrepancy may be due to stigma, lack of access to healthcare
  services, and a patient's primary language being one other than
  English.

- ASD is more common in males, true male-to-female ratio is closer to
  3:1

- The female autism is more likely being misdiagnosed, diagnosed later,
  or overlooked.

- Not only are females less likely to present with overt symptoms, they
  are more likely to mask their social deficits through a process called
  "camouflaging", further hindering a timely diagnosis.

- Several genetic disorders may co-occurr ASD, including fragile X,
  tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, among others.

**Risk Factors during pregnancy:**

- **Mother's health**: Certain conditions in the mother like obesity,
  diabetes, and thyroid disorders have been linked to increased autism
  risk.

- **Infections during pregnancy**: If the mother gets infected during
  pregnancy, especially those with fever, that can be a potential risk
  factor.

- **Environmental exposures**: Exposure to air pollution, pesticides,
  and certain medications during pregnancy may increase risk.

- **Advanced age of parents**: Older parental age, particularly
  mother's, has been associated with a higher risk of ASD.

- **Premature birth and low birth weight**: Babies born prematurely or
  with very low birth weight may have a higher risk of ASD.

- **Genetic factors**: A family history of autism or other genetic
  conditions can increase the risk of ASD.

**Preventive Measures:**

There is no fool proof way to prevent autism. Following measures can
address the risk factors.

- **Mother's health**: Maintain a healthy weight, manage diabetes and
  thyroid conditions, and ensure adequate care during pregnancy.

- **Reduce environmental exposures**: Limit exposure to air pollution,
  pesticides, and unnecessary medications during pregnancy.

- **Prenatal vitamins**: Taking vitamin supplements during pregnancy,
  especially those containing folic acid and vitamin D, may be
  beneficial.

- **Genetic counselling**: If there\'s a family history of autism or
  other genetic conditions, seek genetic counselling.

- **Early intervention**: Even if a child is not diagnosed with ASD,
  early intervention for developmental delays can significantly improve
  outcomes.
