**Myopia, or nearsightedness**

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common vision condition where close
objects appear clear, but distant objects appear blurred. It occurs when
light entering the eye focuses in front of the retina instead of
directly on it. 

**Epidemiology:**

- Myopia is a growing global concern, with higher prevalence in **East
  Asian populations.**

- Prevalence varies by region, with some studies showing a higher
  incidence in urban areas.

- Myopia often develops in **childhood and adolescence**, with a
  tendency to progress during these years.

**Risk Factors:**

- **Genetics**: A strong genetic component. One myopic parent increases
  the risk by two times and two myopic parents increase it by five
  times.

- **Near work**: Excessive time spent on near activities like **reading,
  studying, and screen time** increases the risk.

- **Low outdoor time**: Insufficient outdoor activity, particularly
  natural daylight exposure, is a significant risk factor.

- **Sleep**: **Poor sleep quality** and irregular sleep patterns can
  contribute to myopia development, especially in children and
  adolescents.

- **Ethnicity**: **East Asian and South Asian** individuals have a
  higher risk compared to Caucasians.

- **Binocular vision**: Abnormalities in binocular vision (eye alignment
  and coordination) may also increase risk.

**Prevention**

- **Increase outdoor time**: At least **2 hours** of outdoor activity
  per day is recommended to reduce the risk of myopia onset and
  progression.

- **Reduce near work**: Take regular breaks during near work, increase
  the distance at which you work, and **limit screen time**.

- **Ensure proper sleep**: Aim for adequate sleep duration (**7-9
  hours** for children and adolescents) and establish a regular sleep
  schedule.

- **Regular eye exams**: Early detection and management of myopia can
  help slow down its progression.

- **Other strategies**: Atropine eye drops, progressive lenses, and
  orthokeratology (contact lenses worn overnight to reshape the cornea)
  are some options for myopia management.
