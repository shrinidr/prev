**Dental care**

**Tom Cruise**, who has had veneers and possibly implants, and **George
Clooney**, who has veneers due to teeth grinding. Others, like **Nicolas
Cage**, have had teeth pulled for movie roles and later received
veneers. Some celebrities, like **Demi Moore**, have been open about
losing teeth due to stress and having them restored with veneers. 

Dental veneers, by the way, are thin, custom-made shells crafted from
tooth-colored materials like porcelain or composite resin, designed to
cover the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance.

**Dental caries, or tooth decay, is the most prevalent non-communicable
disease globally**. 

- It affects a vast number of people, with an estimated **2.5
  billion affected worldwide**. 

- The global prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth is around
  **46.2%.** 

- The prevalence in permanent teeth is slightly higher, at approximately
  **53.8%,** according to a 2020 study. 

- While some regions, like Europe, have lower prevalence rates, others,
  particularly in Africa, experience higher rates.

Good dental hygiene guidelines include brushing your teeth twice a day
with fluoride toothpaste, cleaning between your teeth daily with floss
or an interdental brush, and visiting your dentist regularly for
checkups and cleanings.

Limiting sugary foods and drinks, staying hydrated, and not smoking are
also important for maintaining oral health.

**Brushing:**

- **Frequency**: Brush your teeth at least **twice a day**, ideally
  after breakfast and before bed.

- **Technique**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.
  Place the brush at a **45-degree angle** towards the gums and brush
  all surfaces of your teeth, including the backs and sides, using
  gentle, circular motions.

- **Duration**: Brush for at least **two minutes** each time.

**Cleaning Between Teeth:**

- **Importance**: **Flossing or using an interdental brush** is crucial
  because brushing alone cannot reach the spaces between your teeth.

- **Frequency**: Clean between your teeth at least once a day.

- **Technique**: Use about **18 inches of floss**, wrapping each end
  around your middle fingers. Guide the floss between your teeth with
  your thumbs and forefingers, and wrap it snugly around each tooth in a
  C-shape. Use about 10 up and down strokes to clean each surface.

**Other Important Practices:**

- **Diet:** Limit sugary foods and drinks, as they contribute to tooth
  decay. Choose a healthy, balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits,
  vegetables, and dairy products.

- **Fluoride**: Use **fluoridated toothpaste and drink fluoridated
  water**. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent cavities.

- **Regular Dental Visits**: Schedule regular checkups and cleanings
  with your dentist, usually at least **once a year**. More frequent
  visits may be recommended based on your individual needs.

- **Don\'t Smoke**: Smoking has a negative impact on oral health and can
  lead to gum disease and other problems.

- **Replace Toothbrush**: Replace your toothbrush **every 3-4 months**,
  or sooner if the bristles are worn or frayed.

- **Consider Mouthwash**: Mouthwash can help reduce bacteria and freshen
  breath, but it\'s not a substitute for brushing and flossing.
