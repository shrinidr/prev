**Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**

Alfred Hitchcock, the renowned British film director, died in 1980, at
the age of 80, due to kidney failure. **Bobby Fischer**, chess master,
died 2008 of kidney failure. **Greta Garbo**, actress, died 1990 of
kidney failure.

What is kidney failure? Why does it kill people?

We all have **two kidneys** which are bean-shaped organs in our abdomen.
They are responsible for filtering waste and excess fluid from the
blood.

This waste gets carried from kidney to the urinary bladder via ureters
and ultimately is thrown out through urethra. This is what happens when
we urinate.

CKD is a condition where the kidneys are damaged or have structural
problems, making them unable to filter blood effectively.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can progress to end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) or kidney failure, where the kidneys lose their ability to
adequately filter waste and excess fluid from the blood. 

This can lead to a buildup of toxins and fluid in the body, causing
various symptoms and complications. 

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common health problem, often linked to
diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.

**Epidemiology:**

- CKD is a growing public health concern, affecting millions worldwide.

- **Diabetes and high blood pressure** are the leading causes,
  contributing to the majority of cases.

- Obesity, heart disease, and smoking also significantly increase the
  risk.

- Certain racial and ethnic groups, older individuals, and those with a
  family history of CKD are at higher risk.

**Risk Factors:**

- **Diabetes**: High blood sugar damages the blood vessels and
  filtration units in the kidneys, leading to CKD.

- **High Blood Pressure**: Prolonged high blood pressure can narrow
  blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the kidneys.

- **Heart Disease**: Reduced blood flow to the kidneys due to heart
  problems can damage them.

- **Obesity:** Being overweight or obese increases the risk of diabetes
  and high blood pressure, both of which can lead to CKD.

- **Smoking**: Smoking damages blood vessels and can contribute to heart
  disease and high blood pressure, increasing the risk of CKD.

- **Family History**: A family history of kidney disease increases an
  individual\'s risk.

- **Age**: CKD prevalence increases with age, especially in older
  individuals with other chronic conditions.

- **Ethnicity:** Certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Black, Native
  American, and Asian Americans, have a higher risk of developing CKD.

**Prevention:**

- **Manage Diabetes**: Strict blood sugar control can significantly
  reduce the risk of CKD in individuals with diabetes.

- **Control High Blood Pressure**: Maintaining healthy blood pressure
  through lifestyle changes and medication can prevent CKD.

- **Heart Health**: Managing heart disease can reduce the risk of kidney
  damage.

- **Healthy Weight**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can
  lower the risk of diabetes and high blood pressure.

- **Quit Smoking**: Smoking cessation is crucial for preventing kidney
  disease and overall health.

- **Maintain a Healthy Diet**: A balanced diet with limited sodium and
  processed foods can help manage blood pressure and prevent CKD.

- **Regular Exercise**: Physical activity can help control weight, blood
  pressure, and blood sugar levels.

- Regular Checkups: Early detection of kidney problems through regular
  checkups can allow for timely treatment and prevent progression to
  more severe stages of CKD.
