They all suffer from asthma and yet they have been highly successful
sportsperson. Not to forget other celebrities like John F. Kennedy, Beethoven, Charles
Dickens, Elizabeth Taylor, Jessica Alba, Martin Scorsese etc.

Asthma was well known since ages. In Greek language, asthma means
\"panting". HippocratesÂ gave the name to this condition circa 450 BC.
Asthma is a very common chronic respiratory disease present all over the
world. The airways are **inflamed and narrowed** in this disorder,
leading to difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing. Wheeze means to
breathe noisily.

**Epidemiology:**

Asthma is a significant global health problem. The World Health
Organization (WHO) estimates that 350 million people in the world have
asthma.

Asthma prevalence varies across different populations and locations. It is more common in urban areas, likely due to increased exposure to
pollution and other factors.

**Asthma Risk Factors:**

- **Genetic risk:** Individuals having a family history of asthma are at
  higher risk.

- **Environmental factors:** Exposure to allergens (e.g., pollen, dust
  mites, pet dander), irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke, air pollution),
  and infections can trigger or worsen asthma.

- **Lifestyle factors:** An increased risk of asthma has been found with
  smoking, obesity, and low physical activity.

- **Other factors:** if someone had low birth weight, premature birth,
  and exposure to tobacco smoke during early life, the chances of asthma
  can be more.

- **Allergies:** People with other allergic conditions, such as eczema
  or hay fever, are more likely to develop asthma.

**Asthma Prevention:**

We can reduce the chances of asthma by addressing modifiable risk
factors.

- Reduce exposure to tobacco smoke (both active as well as passive
  exposure),

- Reduce exposure to air pollution,

- Reduce exposure to allergens

- Prevent respiratory tract infections like influenza and pneumonia.
  Take vaccines for the same.

- Control obesity.
