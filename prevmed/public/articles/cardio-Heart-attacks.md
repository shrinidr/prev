**Heart attacks**

Heart attacks, or myocardial infarctions, are a major public health
concern globally, with various risk factors contributing to their
occurrence. An estimated 17.9 million people die each year due to heart
attacks !

Let's first understand how the heart attacks happen.

For proper functioning, the heart also needs blood supply which comes
from the coronary arteries.

The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD),
where plaque (a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances)
accumulates in the coronary arteries.

This plaque buildup narrows the arteries, restricting blood flow to the
heart muscle.

Over time, the plaque can rupture, leading to the formation of a blood
clot that further blocks the artery. 

The blood clot, or sometimes a severely narrowed artery, can completely
block blood flow to a portion of the heart muscle. This blockage
deprives the heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients, causing the cells in
that area to become damaged and eventually die if blood flow is not
restored quickly.

**Epidemiology:**

- **Global Burden:** Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks,
  are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

- **Developing vs. Developed Nations:** While CAD is prevalent in both
  developed and developing countries, the transitions in developing
  nations (economic, nutritional, and urban) is leading to increased
  risk and prevalence.

- **Risk Factors:** The most important risk factors for heart attacks
  include unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful
  alcohol consumption.

- **Intermediate Risk Factors:** These behavioural risk factors can
  manifest as raised blood pressure, blood glucose, blood lipids, and
  obesity, which further increase the risk of heart attack.

**Risk Factors:**

While some rick factors can be modified, others are non-modifiable.

**Modifiable Risk Factors:**

- **Lifestyle:**

  - Unhealthy diet (high in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and
    sodium),

  - lack of physical activity, and

  - tobacco use (smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke).

- **Medical Conditions:**

  - High blood pressure,

  - high cholesterol (especially LDL),

  - high triglycerides,

  - diabetes, and

  - obesity.

**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**

- **Age:** Men over 45 and women over 55 are at higher risk.

- **Family History:** A family history of early heart disease increases
  individual risk.

- **Sex:** While the risk gap is narrowing, women are increasingly
  adopting unhealthy behaviors, leading to a rise in risk factors
  traditionally seen in men.

**Prevention Strategies:**

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

- **Diet:** Adopting a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables,
  whole grains, and lean protein, while limiting saturated and trans
  fats, cholesterol, and sodium.

- **Physical Activity:** Engaging in regular physical activity, aiming
  for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of
  vigorous-intensity exercise per week.

- **Smoking Cessation:** Quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to
  second hand smoke is crucial.

- **Limiting Alcohol:** Reducing alcohol consumption to recommended
  levels (no more than one drink per day for women and two for men).

- **Maintaining a Healthy Weight:** Managing weight through diet and
  exercise to reduce the risk of obesity and related conditions.

**Medications:**

Doctors may prescribe medications to manage conditions like high blood
pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, as needed.

Early detection and management of risk factors are crucial for
preventing heart attacks. Regular checkups, including blood pressure,
cholesterol, and blood sugar monitoring, are recommended, especially for
individuals with risk factors or family history.
