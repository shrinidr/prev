**Bipolar disorder**

In 1854, a French psychiatrist, Jules-Gabriel-François
Baillarger described a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent
oscillations between mania and melancholia. He called it a folie à
double forme (\"madness in double form\"). 

This was the beginning of understanding of bipolar disorder which was
earlier known as manic-depressive illness.

It is a mental illness characterized by periods of depression and mania,
and sometimes psychosis. Psychosis, with delusions or hallucinations,
can occur during manic or depressive episodes.

During mania, an individual feels abnormally energetic, happy, or
irritable, and they often make impulsive decisions. Usually they sleep
less during manic phases. 

During periods of depression, the individual may cry, and is sad. Around
6% of these patients may commit suicide, over a period of 20 years.
Almost one-third of the patients attempt suicide in their lifetime.

that one can overcome this problem and achieve great success in life.

**Epidemiology:**

- Prevalence: Bipolar disorder affects about 1% of the population.

<!-- -->

- Age of onset: It typically begins in late adolescence or early
  adulthood, but can occur at any age.

- Sex: Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally, although women
  may experience more depressive episodes and mixed episodes.

- Comorbidity: Bipolar disorder often co-occurs with other mental
  conditions, such as anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.

**Risk Factors:**

- Genetics: A family history of bipolar disorder is a strong risk
  factor.

- Environmental factors: Stressful life events, childhood trauma, and
  substance use can trigger symptoms.

- Neurotransmitter imbalances: Imbalances in brain chemicals like
  serotonin and dopamine may play a role in the development of bipolar
  disorder.

- Brain structure and function: Subtle differences in brain structure
  and function have been observed in individuals with bipolar disorder.

**Prevention:**

- Currently prevention of bipolar disorders is not possible. Studies are
  exploring ways to prevent the onset in high-risk individuals.

- Early identification: Recognizing warning signs and seeking
  professional help early can prevent or mitigate the severity of
  episodes.

- Lifestyle interventions: Maintaining a regular sleep schedule,
  avoiding substance abuse, and engaging in regular exercise can help
  stabilize mood.

- Stress management: Developing healthy coping mechanisms for stress can
  reduce the risk of triggering manic or depressive episodes.

- Support systems: Strong social support networks and access to mental
  health resources can provide valuable assistance.

**In summary:**

Bipolar disorder is a complex disorder with genetic, environmental, and
biological influences. Early identification, lifestyle changes, and
strong support systems are crucial for managing symptoms, preventing
episodes, and improving quality of life.
