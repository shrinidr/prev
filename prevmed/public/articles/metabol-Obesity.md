**Obesity**

Obesity is a chronic disease involving excessive body fat, which can
negatively affect health. It\'s diagnosed using BMI, calculated by
dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m²). A BMI
of 30 or higher indicates obesity. 

Obesity is not just about weight; it\'s about the amount and
distribution of body fat. Adipose tissue, or fat, can also become
dysfunctional and cause inflammation, further contributing to health
problems.

**Epidemiology**

- In 2022, 43% of adults worldwide were overweight (BMI ≥ 25), and 16%
  were obese (BMI ≥ 30), [<u>according to the World Health
  Organization</u>](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight). 

- Overweight and obesity rates have more than doubled since 1980. 

- Obesity prevalence varies significantly across different
  regions. The [<u>Americas</u>](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sca_esv=4976e9c85346e08a&rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN1116IN1117&sxsrf=AE3TifPccLmp2y6HUBa2yA9YxOIvXrIBSg%3A1755175050965&q=Americas&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNxbnLqIqPAxVX3jgGHabBAuYQxccNegQIdBAB&mstk=AUtExfCAqTP_Re6Ix_eeRXydk8pHggErTq6TBmGUBwVjdz8eNHkD1ofpIRdqb_dFk9hc6Sdr1t4F4CljWp21dEnPkLoJoHcOBADKl4vuRjZBE8BzrAuzde95z82aTmnR8Bt6_1CfaHxdVfzLr9nbTwX3VUuZjzgtMrtE3qdpaawQpQLM_VcsJ3BEArdTL-AhkNcK-blTT7Y96458qV1RuUtXMq8EGlMmQuo9ubAP_T-kr2aOxV0kGryf7tkDtY7maZs5rKF9Ql3u1OMt05_F5TN6kTMxWRAfmq4bFPaJ5uwgPxiJDw&csui=3) have

- Childhood and adolescent obesity are also major public health
  concerns, with rates rising dramatically. In 2022, over 390 million
  children and adolescents aged 5-19 were overweight (including
  obesity). 

**Risk Factors:**

Obesity is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental,
and behavioral factors. These include: 

- **Diet:** High intake of calorie-dense, processed foods and sugary
  drinks. 

- **Physical Activity:** Sedentary lifestyles and lack of regular
  exercise. 

- **Socioeconomic Factors:** Poverty and lack of access to healthy food
  options. 

- **Environmental Factors:** Built environment, food availability, and
  cultural norms. 

- **Genetics:** Individual genetic predisposition to weight gain. 

- **Health Consequences:**

Obesity is linked to numerous health problems, including type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease. It also increases the risk of disability and mortality. 

**Prevention**

Obesity prevention focuses on adopting healthy lifestyle habits to
maintain a healthy weight and prevent its associated health risks. Key
strategies include promoting healthy eating, encouraging physical
activity, managing stress, and ensuring adequate sleep.

**1. Healthy Eating:**

- **Focus on Fruits and Vegetables**: Prioritize fruits and vegetables
  in your diet, aiming for five to nine servings daily.

- **Limit Sugary Drinks and Energy-Dense Foods**: Reduce or eliminate
  consumption of sugary drinks, processed foods, and high-fat options.

- **Choose Whole Grains, Lean Proteins, and Low-Fat Dairy**: Opt for
  whole grains, lean protein sources, and low-fat or fat-free dairy
  products.

- **Practice Mindful Eating**: Pay attention to hunger cues, eat slowly,
  and savor your food.

- **Control Portion Sizes**: Be mindful of portion sizes to avoid
  overeating.

**2. Physical Activity:**

- **Engage in Regular Exercise**: Aim for at least 150 minutes of
  moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic
  activity per week.

- **Incorporate Strength Training**: Include strength training exercises
  at least two days per week.

- **Find Activities You Enjoy**: Choose physical activities you find
  enjoyable to make exercise sustainable.

- **Increase Everyday Movement**: Take the stairs, walk instead of
  driving short distances, and engage in active hobbies.

- **Limit Sedentary Behavior**: Reduce time spent sitting or being
  inactive.

**3. Lifestyle Factors:**

  mindfulness, yoga, or spending time in nature.
