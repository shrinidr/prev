**Schizophrenia**

Have you seen the Hollywood movie **A Beautiful Mind** made in 1998?
It was about the life of an economist, John Nash who proposed the famous
game theory. He got Nobel prize for this theory in 1994. Unfortunately,
the great man had been diagnosed with schizophrenia since his college
days !

The disease was first described in 1797. Initially it was thought to be
dementia. In 1908, it was renamed schizophrenia by Eugen Bleuler, a
Swiss psychiatrist. The word, schizophrenia in Latin literally means \"splitting of the
mind\". Its use denotes the separation of function
between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. In the early 20th century, the psychiatrist[<u>Kurt Schneider</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Schneider) categorized the
psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia into two groups: hallucinations and
delusions.

Hallucinations are perceptions that involve hearing, seeing, smelling,
tasting, or feeling things that aren\'t actually present. They can be
quite real for the person experiencing them, and can lead to confusion,
fear, or distress. 

A delusion is a false belief that a person holds despite strong evidence
to the contrary. Examples include believing that others are plotting to
harm you, that you are a famous person, or that you are being controlled
by external forces. 

Schizophrenia is a complex disorder influenced by a mix of genetic and
environmental factors.

**Epidemiology:**

- Schizophrenia is relatively rare, with the highest incidence in young
  adulthood.

- The disorder affects approximately 1 in 300 people worldwide.

- It is more prevalent in males than females, with a slightly higher
  incidence in urban areas compared to rural areas.

- The prevalence varies across different countries and regions.

**Risk Factors:**

- **Family history**: A strong family history of schizophrenia
  significantly increases the risk.

- **Identical twins** share the same genes. If one such twin develops
  schizophrenia, the other twin has a higher chance of developing it.

- On the other hand, if the same happens in **non-identical twins**, the
  chances of other twin developing schizophrenia are lower because they
  share a smaller percentage of genes. 

- **Pregnancy factors**: Complications during pregnancy and delivery,
  such as exposure to toxins, infections, or malnutrition, may increase
  the risk.

- **Substance Use**: Early and heavy use of **cannabis**, in particular,
  has been strongly linked to an increased risk.

- **Environmental Factors**: Life experiences such as **poverty, abuse,
  stress, and traumatic events** can also contribute.

- **Neurodevelopmental Factors**: early brain development disturbances,
  can also lead to the onset of schizophrenia.

- **Social Factors**: **Migration, urban living, and social isolation**
  are also associated with an increased risk.

- **Advanced Age of father**: This has been linked to a higher risk in
  offspring.

**Prevention:**

While there\'s no guaranteed way to prevent schizophrenia, taking
proactive steps to manage risk factors can help reduce the likelihood. 

- Reduce the impact of environmental risk factors like poverty, stress,
  and substance abuse through public health programs.

- Provide comprehensive care during pregnancy - like nutritional
  supplements, managing infections, and minimizing toxin exposure, may
  help reduce the risk.

- Identify individuals at high risk (those with a family history and
  other risk factors), and provide early therapy and medication.

- Substance Abuse Prevention: Promoting education and awareness about
  the dangers of cannabis and other substance abuse can help reduce the
  risk.

- Mental Health Support: Providing support for individuals who may be
  experiencing early signs of psychosis, can help prevent the disorder
  from progressing.
