**Hemorrhoids**

There is nothing embarrassing about piles. It's a very common condition
and has not spared even famous celebrities like Ricky Martin, Kristen
Bell, George Clooney, Demi Lovato, Victoria Beckham, Whitney Houston.

Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are **swollen veins in the anus and
rectum**. When the pressure in the lower rectum increases, these veins
burst open and causes bleeding during defecation. They can also cause
itching, pain, and lumps near the anus.

This is per say not a serious condition and does not cause death. But it
can be quite distressing to the patients. Especially if the bleeding
happens frequently.

Remember everyone has hemorrhoidal tissue, but it only becomes a problem
when it swells or protrudes. 

While they can occur at any age, the risk increases with age, especially
between 45 and 65.

Several factors can be responsible, including dietary habits, lifestyle
choices, and medical conditions.

- Hemorrhoids are a **common condition,**

- Around **50%** of people experience hemorrhoids at some point in their
  lives, with about **5%** suffering from them at any given time.

- The prevalence of hemorrhoids generally **increases with age**,
  peaking between 45 and 65 years.

- Hemorrhoids can affect both **men and women**, but women may
  experience them more frequently, particularly during pregnancy.

They are often caused by **increased pressure in the lower rectum**,
which can result from **straining during bowel movements**, prolonged
sitting, **chronic constipation** or diarrhea, obesity, pregnancy, or
heavy lifting. 

**Risk Factors:**

- **Low-fiber diets** can lead to hard stools and straining during bowel
  movements, increasing the risk of hemorrhoids.

- **Chronic diarrhea** can also contribute to the development of
  hemorrhoids.

- **Sedentary lifestyles and obesity** can increase pressure on the
  veins in the rectum.

- **Straining during defecation, prolonged sitting on the toilet, and
  heavy lifting** can also raise the risk.

- **Pregnancy,** due to increased pressure in the abdominal cavity, can
  contribute to hemorrhoids.

- **Spinal cord injuries and rectal surgery** can also increase the
  risk.

- **Inflammatory bowel disease and anal sex** have also been linked to
  hemorrhoid development.

- **Family history** of hemorrhoids can also increase the risk.

**Prevention:**

- **Increase fiber intake** through fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
  to soften stools and reduce straining.

- Stay hydrated by **drinking plenty of fluids**.

- Engage in **regular physical activity** to improve bowel function and
  maintain a healthy weight.

- More you move, more the bowels will move and the stools will be soft
  and you won't need to strain in the toilet.

- **Avoid prolonged sitting** on the toilet

- **Avoid straining** during bowel movements.

- **Avoid heavy lifting** and

- **Maintain a healthy weight.**

By addressing these risk factors, individuals can significantly reduce
their risk of developing hemorrhoids and also manage if they already
have hemorrhoids.
